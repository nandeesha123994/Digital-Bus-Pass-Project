# 🔧 Activity Log Fatal Error Fix

## ❌ **Error Identified**
```
Fatal error: Cannot redeclare formatCurrency() (previously declared in C:\xampp\htdocs\buspassmsfull\admin-activity-log.php:52) in C:\xampp\htdocs\buspassmsfull\includes\config.php on line 109
```

## 🔍 **Root Cause**
The `formatCurrency()` function was declared twice:
1. **First Declaration**: In `includes/config.php` (line 109)
2. **Second Declaration**: In `admin-activity-log.php` (line 52)

This caused a fatal error because PHP doesn't allow function redeclaration.

## ✅ **Fix Applied**

### **Removed Duplicate Function**
```php
// REMOVED from admin-activity-log.php
// Format currency function
function formatCurrency($amount) {
    return '₹' . number_format($amount, 2);
}
```

### **Kept Original Function**
The original `formatCurrency()` function in `includes/config.php` was kept as it's used throughout the system.
